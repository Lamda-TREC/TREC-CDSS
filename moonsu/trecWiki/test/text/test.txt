Kawasaki disease
Kawasaki disease, also known asKawasaki syndrome,
lymph node syndrome, and mucocutaneous lymph
node syndrome,[1] is an autoimmune disease[2] in which
the medium-sized blood vessels throughout the body be-
come inflamed. It is largely seen in children under five
years of age. It affects many organ systems, mainly those
including the blood vessels, skin, mucous membranes,
and lymph nodes. Its rarest but most serious effect is
on the heart, where it can cause fatal coronary artery
aneurysms in untreated children. Without treatment,
mortality may approach 1%, usually within six weeks of
onset. With treatment, the mortality rate is 0.17% in the
U.S.[3]
Often, a pre-existing viral infection may play a role in its
pathogenesis.[4] The skin, the conjunctivae of the eyes,
and themucousmembranes of themouth become red and
inflamed. Swelling of the hands and feet is often seen and
lymph nodes in the neck are often enlarged. A recurrent
fever, often 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) or higher, is characteristic
of the acute phase of the disease.[5] In untreated children,
the fever lasts about 10 days, but may range from five to
25 days.[5] The disorder was first described in 1967 by
Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan.[6]
1 Classification
Systemic vasculitis is an inflammatory condition affect-
ing arteries and veins throughout the body, and is usu-
ally caused by a proliferation of cells associated with an
immune response to a pathogen, or autoimmunity.[7] Sys-
temic vasculitides may be classified according to the type
of cells involved in the proliferation, as well as the spe-
cific type of tissue damage occurring within the vein or
arterial walls.[7] Under this classification scheme for sys-
temic vasculitis, Kawasaki disease is considered to be a
necrotizing vasculitis (also called necrotizing angeititis),
which may be identified histologically by the occurrence
of necrosis (tissue death), fibrosis, and proliferation of
cells associated with inflammation in the inner layer of
the vascular wall.[7][8] (Other diseases featuring necrotiz-
ing vasculitis include polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis
with polyangiitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and Churg-
Strauss syndrome.[7])
Kawasaki disease may be further classified as a medium-
sized-vessel vasculitis, affecting medium- and small-
sized blood vessels,[9][10][11] such as the smaller cutaneous
vasculature (veins and arteries in the skin) that range from
50 to 100 µm in diameter.[12][13] Kawasaki disease is also
considered to be a primary childhood vasculitis, a disor-
der associated with vasculitis that mainly affects children
under the age of 18.[14][15] A recent, consensus-based
evaluation of vasculitides occurring primarily in children
resulted in a classification scheme for these disorders, to
distinguish them and suggest a more concrete set of di-
agnostic criteria for each.[15] Within this classification of
childhood vasculitides, Kawasaki disease is, again, a pre-
dominantly medium-sized vessel vasculitis.[15]
It is also an autoimmune form of vasculitis,[5] and is not
associated with ANCA antibodies, unlike other vasculitic
disorders associated with them (such as granulomatosis
with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-
Strauss syndrome).[7][16] This categorization is consid-
ered essential for appropriate treatment.[17]
2 Signs and symptoms
Kawasaki disease often begins with a high and persis-
tent fever that is not very responsive to normal treatment
with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen.[18][19]
It is the most prominent symptom in Kawasaki dis-
ease, is a characteristic sign of the acute phase of the
disease, is normally high (above 39-40 °C), remittent,
and is followed by extreme irritability.[19][20] Recently,
it is reported to be present in patients with atypical or
incomplete Kawasaki disease;[21][22] nevertheless, it is
not present in 100% of cases.[23] The first day of fever
is considered the first day of illness,[18] and the dura-
tion of fever is on average one to two weeks; in the
absence of treatment, it may extend for three to four
weeks.[5] Prolonged fever is associated with higher inci-
dence of cardiac involvement.[24] It responds partially to
antipyretic drugs and does not cease with the introduc-
tion of antibiotics.[5] However, when appropriate therapy
is started – intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin – the
fever is gone after two days.[25]
Bilateral conjunctival inflammation was reported to be
the most common symptom after fever.[26][27] It typi-
cally involves the bulbar conjunctivae, is not accompa-
nied by suppuration, and is not painful.[28] It usually be-
gins shortly after the onset of fever during the acute stage
of the disease.[18] Anterior uveitis may be present on slit-
lamp examination.[29][30] Iritis can occur, too.[31] Keratic
precipitates are another eye manifestation (detectable by
a slit lamp but are usually too small to be seen by the un-
aided eye).[18][32]
1
2 2 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Kawasaki disease presents with set of oral manifesta-
tions, the most characteristic changes are the bright red
(erythema), swollen lips (edema) with vertical cracking
(fissures) and bleeding.[33] Themucosa of the oropharynx
may be bright red, and the tongue may have a typical
"strawberry tongue" appearance (marked erythema with
prominent gustative papillae).[5][13] These oral manifesta-
tions are caused by the typical necrotizing microvasculitis
with fibrinoid necrosis.[33]
Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in 50% to 75% of pa-
tients, whereas the other features are estimated to occur in
90% of patients,[18][26] but sometimes it can be the dom-
inant presenting symptom.[32][34] According to the def-
inition of the diagnostic criteria, at least one impaired
lymph node ≥ 1.5 cm in diameter should be involved.[13]
Affected lymph nodes are painless or minimally painful,
nonfluctuant, and nonsuppurative; erythema of the neigh-
boring skin may occur.[18] Children with fever and neck
adenitis who do not respond to antibiotics should have
Kawasaki disease considered as part of the differential
diagnoses.[18]
In the acute phase of the disease, changes in the
peripheral extremities can include erythema of the
palms and soles, which is often striking with sharp
demarcation[18] and often accompanied by painful,
brawny edema of the dorsa of the hands or feet. This
is why affected children frequently refuse to hold ob-
jects in their hands or to bear weight on their feet.[5][18]
Later, during the convalescent or the subacute phase,
desquamation of the fingers and toes usually begins in
the periungual region within two to three weeks after the
onset of fever and may extend to include the palms and
soles.[38] Around 11% of children affected by the disease
may continue skin-peeling for many years.[39] One to two
months after the onset of fever, deep transverse grooves
across the nails may develop (Beau’s lines),[40] and occa-
sionally nails are shed.[40]
The most common cutaneous manifestation is a dif-
fuse macular-papular erythematous rash, which is quite
nonspecific.[41] The rash varies over time and is character-
istically located on the trunk; it may further spread to in-
volve the face, extremities, and perineum.[5] Many other
forms of cutaneous lesions have been reported; they may
include scarlatiniform, papular, urticariform, multiform-
like erythema, and purpuric lesions; even micropustules
were reported.[42][43] It can be polymorphic, not itchy,
and normally observed up to the fifth day of fever.[44]
However, it is never bullous or vesicular.[5]
In the acute stage of Kawasaki disease, systemic inflam-
matory changes are evident in many organs.[10] Joint pain
(arthralgia) and swelling, frequently symmetrical, and
arthritis can also occur.[26] Myocarditis,[45] diarrhea,[13]
pericarditis, valvulitis, aseptic meningitis, pneumonitis,
lymphadenitis, and hepatitis may be present and are man-
ifested by the presence of inflammatory cells in the af-
fected tissues.[10] If left untreated, some symptoms will
eventually relent, but coronary artery aneurysms will not
improve, resulting in a significant risk of death or disabil-
ity due tomyocardial infarction.[13] If treated quickly, this
risk can be mostly avoided and the course of illness cut
short.[46]
Clinical manifestations and time course of Kawasaki
disease[18][47]
Other reported nonspecific symptoms include cough,
rhinorrhea, sputum, vomiting, headache, and seizure.[26]
The course of the disease can be divided into three clin-
ical phases.[13]
 The acute febrile phase, which usually lasts for one
to two weeks, is characterized by fever, conjunctival
injection, erythema of the oral mucosa, erythema
and swelling of the hands and feet, rash, cervi-
cal adenopathy, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, and
hepatic dysfunction.[13] Myocarditis is common
during this time, and a pericardial effusion may
be present.[18] Coronary arteritis may be present,
but aneurysms are generally not yet visible by
echocardiography.
 The subacute phase begins when fever, rash, and
lymphadenopathy resolve at about one to two weeks
after the onset of fever, but irritability, anorexia,
and conjunctival injection persist. Desquamation
of the fingers and toes and thrombocytosis are seen
during this stage, which generally lasts until about
four weeks after the onset of fever. Coronary artery
aneurysms usually develop during this time, and the
risk for sudden death is highest.[18][48]
 The convalescent stage begins when all clinical signs
of illness have disappeared, and continues until the
sedimentation rate returns to normal, usually at six
to eight weeks after the onset of illness.[13]
The clinical presentation between adults and children dif-
fers, as adults’ neck lymph nodes are more affected (93%
of adults versus 15% of children), hepatitis (65% versus
2.2 Other 3
10%), and arthralgia (61% versus 24-38%).[13][49] Some
patients have atypical presentations and may not have the
classical symptoms. This occurs in particular in young
infants;[50] those patients are especially at higher risk for
cardiac artery aneurysms.[18][51]

2.1 Cardiac
The cardiac complications are the most important aspect
of Kawasaki disease. It is the main cause of heart disease
acquired in childhood in the United States and Japan.[13]
In developed nations, it appears to have replaced acute
rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired
heart disease in children.[18] Coronary artery aneurysms
occur as a sequela of the vasculitis in 20-25% of untreated
children.[52] It is first detected at a mean of 10 days of
illness and the peak frequency of coronary artery dila-
tion or aneurysms occurs within four weeks of onset.[48]
Aneurysms are classified into small (internal diameter of
vessel wall <5 mm), medium (diameter ranging from 5–
8 mm), and giant (diameter > 8 mm).[13] Saccular and
fusiform aneurysms usually develop between 18 and 25
days after the onset of illness.[18] Even when treated with
high-dose IVIG regimens within the first 10 days of ill-
ness, 5% of children with Kawasaki disease develop at the
least transient coronary artery dilation and 1% develop
giant aneurysms.[53][54][55] Death can occur due either to
myocardial infarction secondary to blood clot formation
in a coronary artery aneurysm or to rupture of a large
coronary artery aneurysm. Death is most common two to
12 weeks after the onset of illness.[18]
Many risk factors predicting coronary artery aneurysms
have been identified,[24] including persistent fever af-
ter IVIG therapy,[56][57] low hemoglobin concentrations,
low albumin concentrations, high white-blood-cell count,
high band count, high CRP concentrations, male sex, and
age less than one year.[58] Coronary artery lesions re-
sulting from Kawasaki disease change dynamically with
time.[5] Resolution one to two years after the onset of the
disease has been observed in half of vessels with coro-
nary aneurysms.[59][60] Narrowing of the coronary artery,
which occurs as a result of the healing process of the ves-
sel wall, often leads to significant obstruction of the blood
vessel and lead to the heart not receiving enough blood
and oxygen.[59] This can eventually lead to heart muscle
tissue death (myocardial infarction).[59]
MI caused by thrombotic occlusion in an aneurysmal,
stenotic, or both aneurysmal and stenotic coronary artery
is the main cause of death fromKawasaki disease.[61] The
highest risk of MI occurs in the first year after the onset
of the disease.[61] MI in children presents with different
symptoms from those in adults. Themain symptomswere
shock, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain; chest pain
was most common in older children.[61] Most of these
children had the attack occurring during sleep or at rest,
and around one-third of attacks were asymptomatic.[18]
Valvular insufficiencies, particularly of mitral or tricuspid
valves, are often observed in the acute phase of
Kawasaki disease due to inflammation of the heart valve
or inflammation of the heart muscle-induced myocar-
dial dysfunction, regardless of coronary involvement.[59]
These lesions mostly disappear with the resolution of
acute illness,[62] but a very small group of the lesions
persist and progress.[63] There is also late-onset aortic or
mitral insufficiency caused by thickening or deformation
of fibrosed valves, with the timing ranging from several
months to years after the onset of Kawasaki disease.[64]
Some of these lesions require valve replacement.[65]
2.2 Other
Other Kawasaki disease complications have been
described, such as aneurysm of other arteries: aortic
aneurysm,[66] with a higher number of reported cases
involving the abdominal aorta,[67][68] axillary artery
aneurysm,[69] brachiocephalic artery aneurysm,[70]
aneurysm of iliac and femoral arteries, and renal
artery aneurysm.[5][71] Other vascular complications
can occur such as increased wall thickness and de-
creased distensibility of carotid arteries,[72] aorta,[73]
and brachioradial artery.[74] This change in the vas-
cular tone secondary to endothelial dysfunction.[71]
In addition, children with Kawasaki disease, with or
without coronary artery complications, may have a more
adverse cardiovascular risk profile,[74] such as high blood
pressure, obesity, and abnormal serum lipid profile.[75]
Gastrointestinal complications in Kawasaki disease are
similar to those observed in Henoch-Schönlein pur-
pura,[69] such as: intestinal obstruction,[76] colon
swelling,[77] intestinal ischemia,[78] intestinal pseudo-
obstruction,[79] and acute abdomen.[80]
Eye changes associated with the disease have been
described since the 1980s, being found as uveitis,
iridocyclitis, conjunctival hemorrhage,[81][82][83] optic
neuritis,[69] amaurosis, and ocular artery obstruction.[84]
4 4 DIAGNOSIS
It can also be found as necrotizing vasculitis, progressing
into peripheral gangrene.[85]
The neurological complications per central nervous
system lesions are increasingly reported.[86] The neuro-
logical complications found are meningoencephalitis,[87]
subdural effusion,[88][89] cerebral hypoperfusion,[90]
cerebral ischemia and infarct,[91] cerebellar infarction,[92]
manifesting with seizures, chorea, hemiplegia, mental
confusion, lethargy and coma,[69] or even a cerebral
infarction with no neurological manifestations.[91]
Other neurological complications from cranial nerve
involvement are reported as ataxia,[69] facial palsy,[93]
and sensorineural hearing loss.[94][95] Behavioral
changes are thought to be caused by localised cerebral
hypoperfusion,[90] can include attention deficits, learning
deficits, emotional disorders (emotional lability, fear of
night, and night terrors), and internalization problems
(anxious, depressive or aggressive behavior).[96][97]
3 Causes
As the cause(s) of Kawasaki disease remain unknown,
the illness is more accurately referred to as Kawasaki
syndrome. Like all autoimmune diseases, its cause is
presumably the interaction of genetic and environmen-
tal factors, possibly including an infection. The specific
cause is unknown,[98][99][100] but current theories center
primarily on immunological causes. Evidence increas-
ingly points to an infectious etiology,[101] but debate con-
tinues on whether the cause is a conventional antigenic
substance or a superantigen.[102] Researchers at Boston
Children’s Hospital reported, “some studies have found
associations between the occurrence of Kawasaki disease
and recent exposure to carpet cleaning or residence near
a body of stagnant water; however, cause and effect have
not been established.”[103]
Other data show a clear correlation between Kawasaki
disease and tropospheric wind patterns; winds blowing
from central Asia correlate with Kawasaki disease cases
in Japan, Hawaii, and San Diego.[104] This association
with tropospheric winds has been shown to be modulated
at seasonal and interannual timescales by the El Niño–
Southern Oscillation phenomenon,[105] further indicat-
ing the agent responsible for the disease is a wind-borne
pathogen. Efforts are underway to identify the suspected
pathogen in air-filters flown at altitude above Japan.[106]
An association has been identified with an SNP in the
ITPKC gene, which codes an enzyme that negatively reg-
ulates T-cell activation.[107] Regardless of where they
are living, Japanese children are more likely than other
children to manifest the disease, which suggests ge-
netic susceptibility.[103] The HLA-B51 serotype has been
found to be associated with endemic instances of the
disease.[108]
4 Diagnosis

mm in diameter
Kawasaki disease can only be diagnosed clinically (i.e.,
by medical signs and symptoms). No specific laboratory
test exists for this condition. It is difficult to establish
the diagnosis, especially early in the course of the ill-
ness, and frequently children are not diagnosed until they
have seen several health-care providers. Many other se-
rious illnesses can cause similar symptoms, and must be
considered in the differential diagnosis, including scarlet
fever, toxic shock syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis,
and childhood mercury poisoning (infantile acrodynia).
Classically, five days of fever[110] plus four of five
diagnostic criteria must be met to establish the diagno-
sis. The criteria are:
1. erythema of the lips or oral cavity or cracking of the
lips
2. rash on the trunk
3. swelling or erythema of the hands or feet
4. red eyes (conjunctival injection)
5. swollen lymph node in the neck of at least 15 mm
Many children, especially infants, eventually diagnosed
with Kawasaki disease, do not exhibit all of the above
criteria. In fact, many experts now recommend treat-
ing for Kawasaki disease even if only three days of fever
have passed and at least three diagnostic criteria are
present, especially if other tests reveal abnormalities con-
sistent with Kawasaki disease. In addition, the diagnosis
can be made purely by the detection of coronary artery
aneurysms in the proper clinical setting.
54.1 Investigations
A physical examination will demonstrate many of the fea-
tures listed above.
Blood tests
 Complete blood count may reveal normocytic
anemia and eventually thrombocytosis.
 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be elevated.
 C-reactive protein will be elevated.
 Liver function tests may show evidence of hepatic
inflammation and low serum albumin.
Other optional tests include:
 Electrocardiogram may show evidence of
ventricular dysfunction or, occasionally, arrhythmia
due to myocarditis.
 Echocardiogram may show subtle coronary artery
changes or, later, true aneurysms.
 Ultrasound or computerized tomography may show
hydrops (enlargement) of the gallbladder.
 Urinalysis may show white blood cells and protein in
the urine (pyuria and proteinuria) without evidence
of bacterial growth.
 Lumbar puncture may show evidence of aseptic
meningitis.
 Angiography was historically used to detect coro-
nary artery aneurysms, and remains the gold stan-
dard for their detection, but is rarely used today un-
less coronary artery aneurysms have already been
detected by echocardiography.
 Temporal artery biopsy
5 Treatment
Children with Kawasaki disease should be hospitalized
and cared for by a physician who has experience with
this disease. When in an academic medical center, care
is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric
rheumatology, and pediatric infectious disease specialists
(although no specific infectious agent has been identified
as yet).[103] Treatment should be started as soon as the
diagnosis is made to prevent damage to the coronary ar-
teries.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the standard treat-
ment for Kawasaki disease[111] and is administered in
high doses with marked improvement usually noted
within 24 hours. If the fever does not respond, an ad-
ditional dose may have to be considered. In rare cases,
a third dose may be given to the child. IVIG by itself is
most useful within the first seven days of onset of fever,
in terms of preventing coronary artery aneurysm.
Salicylate therapy, particularly aspirin, remains an im-
portant part of the treatment (though questioned by
some)[112] but salicylates alone are not as effective as
IVIG. Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the
fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when
the patient returns home, usually for two months to pre-
vent blood clots from forming. Except for Kawasaki
disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise
normally not recommended for children due to its as-
sociation with Reye’s syndrome. Because children with
Kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to several
months, vaccination against varicella and influenza is re-
quired, as these infections are most likely to cause Reye’s
syndrome.[113]
Corticosteroids have also been used,[114] especially when
other treatments fail or symptoms recur, but in a
randomized controlled trial, the addition of corticos-
teroid to immune globulin and aspirin did not improve
outcome.[115] Additionally, corticosteroid use in the set-
ting of Kawasaki disease is associated with increased risk
of coronary artery aneurysm, so its use is generally con-
traindicated in this setting. In cases of Kawasaki dis-
ease refractory to IVIG, cyclophosphamide and plasma
exchange have been investigated as possible treatments,
with variable outcomes.
IL-1 Receptor antagonist (anakinra) can prevent coronary
lesion in the mouse KD model. This prevention shows
even with three-days-delay in treatment in mice.[116]
Treatments exist for iritis and other eye symptoms. An-
other treatment may include the use of infliximab. Inflix-
imab works by binding tumour necrosis factor alpha.[117]
6 Prognosis
With early treatment, rapid recovery from the acute
symptoms can be expected, and the risk of coronary
artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute
symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (i.e. the
patient will recover eventually), but the risk of coronary
artery involvement is much greater. Overall, about 2%
of patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis.
Patients who have had Kawasaki disease should have an
echocardiogram initially every few weeks, and then ev-
ery one or two years to screen for progression of cardiac
involvement.
Laboratory evidence of increased inflammation com-
bined with demographic features (male sex, age less
than six months or greater than eight years) and in-
complete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of
a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease.[58][118] The
likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to
be determined in large measure by its initial size, in
6 9 REFERENCES
which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood
of regression.[119][120] Other factors are positively asso-
ciated with the regression of aneurysms, including being
younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease,
fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and
an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment.[60]
The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among
those who develop large aneurysms.[5] The worst prog-
nosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms.[121] This
severe outcome may require further treatment such
as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty,[122] coronary
artery stenting,[123] bypass grafting,[124] and even cardiac
transplantation.[125]
A relapse of symptoms may occur soon after initial treat-
ment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization
and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic
and nonallergic acute reactions, aseptic meningitis, fluid
overload and, rarely, other serious reactions. Overall,
life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for
Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially com-
pared with the risk of nontreatment. Also, evidence indi-
cates Kawasaki disease produces altered lipidmetabolism
that persists beyond clinical resolution of the disease.
7 Epidemiology
Kawasaki disease affects boys more than girls, with peo-
ple of Asian ethnicity, particularly Japanese and Ko-
rean people, most susceptible, as well as people of Afro-
Caribbean ethnicity. The disease was rare in Caucasians
until the last few decades, and incidence rate fluctuates
from country to country.
Currently, Kawasaki disease is the most commonly diag-
nosed pediatric vasculitis in the world. By far, the high-
est incidence of Kawasaki disease occurs in Japan, with
the most recent study placing the attack rate at 218.6 per
100,000 children <5 years of age (about one in 450 chil-
dren). At this present attack rate, more than one in 150
children in Japan will develop Kawasaki disease during
their lifetimes.
However, its incidence in the United States is increasing.
Kawasaki disease is predominantly a disease of young
children, with 80% of patients younger than five years of
age. About 2,000-4,000 cases are identified in the U.S.
each year (9 to 19 per 100,000 children younger than 5
years of age).[103][126][127]
In the United Kingdom, estimates of incidence rate vary
because of the rarity of Kawasaki disease. However,
it is believed to affect fewer than one in every 25,000
people.[128] Incidence of the disease doubled from 1991
to 2000, however, with four cases per 100,000 children
in 1991 compared with a rise of eight cases per 100,000
in 2000.[129]
8 History
The disease was first reported by Tomisaku Kawasaki in a
four-year-old child with a rash and fever at the Red Cross
Hospital in Tokyo in January 1961, and he later pub-
lished a report on 50 similar cases.[130] Later, Kawasaki
and colleagues were persuaded of definite cardiac in-
volvement when they studied and reported 23 cases, of
which 11 (48%) patients had abnormalities detected by
an electrocardiogram.[131] In 1974, the first description
of this disorder was published in the English-language
literature.[132] In 1976, Melish et al. described the same
illness in 16 children in Hawaii.[133] Melish and Kawasaki
had independently developed the same diagnostic criteria
for the disorder, which are still used today to make the di-
agnosis of classic Kawasaki disease.
A question was raised whether the disease only started
during the period between 1960 and 1970, but later a pre-
served heart of a seven-year-old boy who died in 1870
was examined and showed three aneurysms of the coro-
nary arteries with clots, as well as pathologic changes
consistent with Kawasaki disease.[134] Kawasaki disease
is now recognized worldwide. In the United States and
other developed nations, it appears to have replaced acute
rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired
heart disease in children.[135]
