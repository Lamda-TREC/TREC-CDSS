  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also 
known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), 
and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), 
among others, is a type of obstructive lung disease 
characterized by chronically poor airflow. It typically 
worsens over time. The main symptoms include 
shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production.[1] 
Most people with chronic bronchitis have COPD.[2] 
Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD, 
with a number of other factors such as air pollution and 
genetics playing a smaller role.[3] In the developing 
world, one of the common sources of air pollution is 
from poorly vented cooking and heating fires. Long-term 
exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory 
response in the lungs resulting in narrowing of the small 
airways and breakdown of lung tissue known as 
emphysema.[4] The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as 
measured by lung function tests.[5] In contrast to asthma, 
the airflow reduction does not improve significantly with 
the administration of medication. 
COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to the 
known causes. This includes efforts to decrease rates of 
smoking and to improve indoor and outdoor air quality. 
COPD treatments include quitting smoking, 
vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled 
bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit 
from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation.[4] 
In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased 
use of medications and hospitalization may be needed. 
Worldwide, COPD affects 329 million people or nearly 
5% of the population.[6] In 2013, it resulted in 2.9 million 
deaths up from 2.4 million deaths in 1990.[7] The number 
of deaths is projected to increase due to higher smoking 
rates and an aging population in many countries.[8] It 
resulted in an estimated economic cost of $2.1 trillion in 
2010.[9] 
1 Signs and symptoms 
The most common symptoms of COPD are sputum 
production, shortness of breath and a productive 
cough.[10] These symptoms are present for a prolonged 
period of time[2] and typically worsen over time.[4] It is 
unclear if different types of COPD exist.[3] While 
previously divided into emphysema and chronic 
bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung 
changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic 
bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms that may 
or may not occur with COPD.[1] 
1.1 Cough 
A chronic cough is often the first symptom to occur. 
When it exists for more than three months a year for 
more than two years, in combination with sputum 
production and without another explanation, there is 
by definition chronic bronchitis. This condition can 
occur before COPD fully develops. The amount of 
sputum produced can change over hours to days. In 
some cases the cough may not be present or only 
occurs occasionally and may not be productive. Some 
people with COPD attribute the symptoms to a 
“smoker’s cough”. Sputum may be swallowed or spat 
out, depending often on social and cultural factors. 
Vigorous coughing may lead to rib fractures or a brief 
loss of consciousness. Those with COPD often have a 
history of "common colds" that last a long time.[10] 
1.2 Shortness of breath 
Shortness of breath is often the symptom that bothers 
people the most.[11] It is commonly described as: “my 
breathing requires effort,” “I feel out of breath,” or “I 
can't get enough air in”.[12] Different terms, however, 
may be used in different cultures.[10] Typically the 
shortness of breath is worse on exertion of a prolonged 
duration and worsens over time.[10] In the advanced 
stages it occurs during rest and may be always 
present.[13][14] It is a source of both anxiety and a poor 
quality of life in those with COPD.[10] Many people 
with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed 
lips and this action can improve shortness of breath in 
some.[15][16] 
1.3 Other features 
In COPD, it may take longer to breathe out than to 
breathe in.[17] Chest tightness may occur[10] but is not 
common and may be caused by another problem.[11] 
Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or 
decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the 
chest with a stethoscope.[17] A barrel chest is a 
characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively 
2 
 
uncommon.[17] Tripod positioning may occur as the 
disease worsens.[2] 
Advanced COPD leads to high pressure on the lung 
arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the 
heart.[4][18][19] 
1 
This situation is referred to as cor pulmonale, and leads 
to symptoms of leg swelling[10] and bulging neck veins.[4] 
COPD is more common than any other lung disease as a 
cause of cor pulmonale.[18] Cor pulmonale has become 
less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.[2] 
COPD often occurs along with a number of other 
conditions, due in part to shared risk factors.[3] These 
conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood 
pressure, diabetes mellitus, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, 
lung cancer, anxiety disorder and depression.[3] In those 
with severe disease a feeling of always being tired is 
common.[10] Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD 
and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung 
cancer.[20] 
1.4 Exacerbation 
An acute exacerbation of COPD is defined as increased 
shortness of breath, increased sputum production, a 
change in the color of the sputum from clear to green or 
yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with 
COPD.[17] This may present with signs of increased work 
of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, 
sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish 
tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in 
very severe exacerbations.[17][21] Crackles may also be 
heard over the lungs on examination with a 
stethoscope.[22] 
2 Cause 
The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke, with 
occupational exposure and pollution from indoor fires 
being significant causes in some countries.[1] Typically 
these exposures must occur over several decades before 
symptoms develop.[1] A person’s genetic makeup also 
affects the risk.[1] 
2.1 Smoking

1990s early 2000s 
 
 2 CAUSE 
Percentage of males smoking tobacco as of the late 1990s 
early 2000s. Note the scales used for females and 
males differ.[23] 
The primary risk factor for COPD globally is tobacco 
smoking.[1] Of those who smoke about 20% will get 
COPD,[24] and of those who are lifelong smokers about 
half will get COPD.[25] In the United States and United 
Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either 
current smokers or previously smoked.[24][26][27] The 
likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total 
smoke exposure.[28] Additionally, women are more 
susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men.[27] 
In nonsmokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 
20% of cases.[26] Other types of smoke, such as 
marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a 
risk.[1] Women who smoke during pregnancy may 
increase the risk of COPD in their child.[1] 
2.2 Air pollution 
Poorly ventilated cooking fires, often fueled by coal or 
biomass fuels such as wood and animal dung, lead to 
indoor air pollution and are one of the most common 
causes of COPD in developing countries.[29] These fires 
are a method of cooking and heating for nearly 3 billion 
people with their health effects being greater among 
women due to more exposure.[1][29] They are used as the 
main source of energy in 80% of homes in India, China 
and sub-Saharan Africa.[30] 
People who live in large cities have a higher rate of 
COPD compared to people who live in rural areas.[31] 
While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in 
exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is 
unclear.[1] Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including 
that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of 
COPD.[30] The overall effect in relation to smoking, 
however, is believed to be small.[1] 
2.3 Occupational exposures 
Intense and prolonged exposure to workplace dusts, 
chemicals and fumes increase the risk of COPD in both 
smokers and nonsmokers.[32] Workplace exposures are 
3 
 
believed to be the cause in 10–20% of cases.[33] In the 
United States they are believed to be related to more than 
30% of cases among those who have never smoked and 
probably represent a greater risk in countries without 
sufficient regulations.[1] 
A number of industries and sources have been implicated, 
including[30] high levels of dust in coal mining, gold 
mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations 
involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from 
welding.[32] Working in agriculture is also a risk.[30] In 
some professions the risks have been estimated as 
equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a 
day.[34] Silica dust exposure can also lead to COPD, with 
the risk unrelated to that for silicosis.[35] The negative 
effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure 
appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.[34] 
2.4 Genetics 
Genetics play a role in the development of COPD.[1] It is 
more common among relatives of those with COPD who 
smoke than unrelated smokers.[1] Currently, the only 
clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin 
deficiency (AAT).[36] This risk is particularly high if 
someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes.[36] 
It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases[36][37] and the 
condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people.[2] 
Other genetic factors are being investigated,[36] of which 
there are likely to be many.[30] 
2.5 Other 
A number of other factors are less closely linked to 
COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, 
although it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or 
other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air 
pollution and malnutrition.[1] There is tentative evidence 
that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at 
increased risk of COPD.[1] Birth factors such as low birth 
weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious 
diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.[1] 
Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear 
to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.[2] 
2.6 Exacerbations 
An acute exacerbation (a sudden worsening of 
symptoms)[38] is commonly triggered by infection or 
environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other factors 
such as improper use of medications.[39] Infections 
appear to be the cause of 50 to 75% of cases,[39][40] with 
bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%.[41] 
Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and 
outdoor air quality.[39] Exposure to personal smoke and 
secondhand smoke increases the risk.[30] Cold 
temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations 
occurring more commonly in winter.[42] Those with more 
severe underlying disease have more frequent 
exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 
to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year.[43] Those with many 
exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their 
lung function.[44] Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the 
lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing 
COPD.[3] 
3 Pathophysiology

showing a detailed cross-section of normal bronchioles and 
alveoli. On the right is lungs damaged by COPD with an inset 
showing a cross-section of damaged bronchioles and alveoli 
COPD is a type of obstructive lung disease in which 
chronic incompletely reversible poor airflow (airflow 
limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) 
exist.[3] The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of 
lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways 
disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The 
relative contributions of these two factors vary between 
people.[1] Severe destruction of small airways can lead to 
the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—
that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called 
bullous emphysema.[45] 
 
Micrograph showing emphysema (left – large empty spaces) 
and lung tissue with relative preservation of the alveoli (right). 
COPD develops as a significant and chronic 
inflammatory response to inhaled irritants.[1] Chronic 
bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory 
state.[44] The inflammatory cells involved include 
neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of 
white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have 
Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with 
COPD have eosinophil involvement similar to that in 
4 
 
asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by 
inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. 
Other processes involved with lung damage include 
oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free 
radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory 
cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the 
lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by 
protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective 
tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which 
then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor 
absorption and release of respiratory gases.[1] General 
muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly 
due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into 
the blood.[1] 
Narrowing of the airways occurs due to inflammation 
and scarring within them. This contributes to the 
inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air 
flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the 
chest is compressing the airways at this time.[46] This can 
result in more air from the previous breath remaining 
within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting 
in an increase in the total volume of air in the lungs at 
any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air 
trapping.[46][47] Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to 
shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to 
breathe in when the lungs are already partly full.[48] 
Some also have a degree of airway hyperresponsiveness 
to irritants similar to those found in asthma.[2] 
Low oxygen levels and, eventually, high carbon dioxide 
levels in the blood can occur from poor gas exchange due 
to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, 
hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe.[1] During 
exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, 
resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory 
airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This can also lead 
to insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood 
oxygen levels.[4] Low oxygen levels, if present for a 
prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries 
in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of 
capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in 
increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, 
which may cause cor pulmonale.[1] 
4 Diagnosis

The diagnosis of COPD should be considered in anyone 
over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath, a 
chronic cough, sputum production, or frequent winter 
colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for 4
 DIAGNOSIS 
the disease.[10][11] Spirometry is then used to confirm the 
diagnosis.[10][49] 
4.1 Spirometry 
Spirometry measures the amount of airflow obstruction 
present and is generally carried out after the use of a 
bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways.[49] 
Two main components are measured to make the 
diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second 
(FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be 
breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced 
vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air 
that can be breathed out in a single large breath.[50] 
Normally, 75– 80% of the FVC comes out in the first 
second[50] and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in 
someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as 
having the disease.[49] Based on these measurements, 
spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the 
elderly.[49] The National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less 
than 80% of predicted.[11] 
Evidence for using spirometry among those without 
symptoms in an effort to diagnose the condition earlier 
is of uncertain effect and is therefore currently not 
recommended.[10][49] A peak expiratory flow (the 
maximum speed of expiration), commonly used in 
asthma, is not sufficient for the diagnosis of COPD.[11] 
5 
 
4.2 Severity 
There are a number of methods to determine how much 
COPD is affecting a given individual.[10] The modified 
British Medical Research Council questionnaire 
(mMRC) or the COPD assessment test (CAT) are simple 
questionnaires that may be used to determine the severity 
of symptoms.[10] Scores on CAT range from 0–40 with 
the higher the score, the more severe the disease.[51] 
Spirometry may help to determine the severity of airflow 
limitation.[10] This is typically based on the FEV1 
expressed as a percentage of the predicted “normal” for 
the person’s age, gender, height and weight.[10] Both the 
American and European guidelines recommended partly 
basing treatment recommendations on the FEV1.[49] The 
GOLD guidelines suggest dividing people into four 
categories based on symptoms assessment and airflow 
limitation.[10] Weight loss and muscle weakness, as well 
as the presence of other diseases, should also be taken 
into account.[10] 
4.3 Other tests 
A chest X-ray and complete blood count may be useful 
to exclude other conditions at the time of diagnosis.[52] 
Characteristic signs on X-ray are overexpanded lungs, a 
flattened diaphragm, increased retrosternal airspace, and 
5.1 Smoking cessation 
bullae while it can help exclude other lung diseases, such 
as pneumonia, pulmonary edema or a pneumothorax.[53] 
A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the 
chest may show the distribution of emphysema 
throughout the lungs and can also be useful to exclude 
other lung diseases.[2] Unless surgery is planned, 
however, this rarely affects management.[2] An analysis 
of arterial blood is used to determine the need for oxygen; 
this is recommended in those with an FEV1 less than 35% 
predicted, those with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 
less than 92% and those with symptoms of congestive 
heart failure.[10] In areas of the world where alpha-1 
antitrypsin deficiency is common, people with COPD 
(particularly those below the age of 45 and with 
emphysema affecting the lower parts of the lungs) 
should be considered for 
testing.[10] 
• Chest X-ray demonstrating severe COPD. Note the 
small heart size in comparison to the lungs. 
• A lateral chest x-ray of a person with emphysema. 
Note the barrel chest and flat diaphragm. • Lung 
bulla as seen on CXR in a person with severe COPD 
• A severe case of bullous emphysema 
• Axial CT image of the lung of a person with 
endstage bullous emphysema. 
4.4 Differential diagnosis 
COPD may need to be differentiated from other causes 
of shortness of breath such as congestive heart failure, 
pulmonary embolism, pneumonia or pneumothorax. 
Many people with COPD mistakenly think they have 
asthma.[17] The distinction between asthma and COPD is 
made on the basis of the symptoms, smoking history, and 
whether airflow limitation is reversible with 
bronchodilators at spirometry.[54] Tuberculosis may also 
present with a chronic cough and should be considered 
in locations where it is common.[10] Less common 
conditions that may present similarly include 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia and obliterative 
bronchiolitis.[52] Chronic bronchitis may occur with 
normal airflow and in this situation it is not classified as 
COPD.[2] 
5 Prevention 
Most cases of COPD are potentially preventable through 
decreasing exposure to smoke and improving air 
quality.[30] Annual influenza vaccinations in those with 
COPD reduce exacerbations, hospitalizations and 
death.[55][56] Pneumococcal vaccination may also be 
beneficial.[55] 
5.1 Smoking cessation 
Keeping people from starting smoking is a key aspect of 
preventing COPD.[57] The policies of governments, 
public health agencies and anti-smoking organizations 
can reduce smoking rates by discouraging people from 
starting and encouraging people to stop smoking.[58] 
Smoking bans in public areas and places of work are 
important measures to decrease exposure to secondhand 
smoke and while many places have instituted bans more 
are recommended.[30] 
In those who smoke, stopping smoking is the only 
measure shown to slow down the worsening of COPD.[59] 
Even at a late stage of the disease, it can reduce the rate 
of worsening lung function and delay the onset of 
disability and death.[60] Smoking cessation starts with the 
decision to stop smoking, leading to an attempt at 
quitting. Often several attempts are required before long-
term abstinence is achieved.[58] Attempts over 5 years 
lead to success in nearly 40% of people.[61] 
Some smokers can achieve long-term smoking cessation 
through willpower alone. Smoking, however, is highly 
addictive,[62] and many smokers need further support. 
6 
 
The chance of quitting is improved with social support, 
engagement in a smoking cessation program and the use 
of medications such as nicotine replacement therapy, 
bupropion or varenicline.[58][61] 
5.2 Occupational health 
A number of measures have been taken to reduce the 
likelihood that workers in at-risk industries—such as 
coal mining, construction and stonemasonry—will 
develop COPD.[30] Examples of these measures include: 
the creation of public policy,[30] education of workers and 
management about the risks, promoting smoking 
cessation, checking workers for early signs of COPD, 
use of respirators, and dust control.[63][64] Effective dust 
control can be achieved by improving ventilation, using 
water sprays and by using mining techniques that 
minimize dust generation.[65] If a worker develops COPD, 
further lung damage can be reduced by avoiding ongoing 
dust exposure, for example by changing the work role.[66] 
5.3 Air pollution 
Both indoor and outdoor air quality can be improved, 
which may prevent COPD or slow the worsening of 
existing disease.[30] This may be achieved by public 
policy efforts, cultural changes, and personal 
involvement.[67] 
A number of developed countries have successfully 
improved outdoor air quality through regulations. This 
has resulted in improvements in the lung function of their 
populations.[30] Those with COPD may experience fewer 
symptoms if they stay indoors on days when outdoor air 
quality is poor.[4] 
One key effort is to reduce exposure to smoke from 
cooking and heating fuels through improved ventilation 
of homes and better stoves and chimneys.[67] Proper 
stoves may improve indoor air quality by 85%. Using 
alternative energy sources such as solar cooking and 
electrical heating is effective, as is using fuels such as 
kerosene or coal rather than biomass.[30] 
6 Management 
There is no known cure for COPD, but the symptoms are 
treatable and its progression can be delayed.[57] The 
major goals of management are to reduce risk factors, 
manage stable COPD, prevent and treat acute 
exacerbations, and manage associated illnesses.[4] The 
only measures that have been shown to reduce mortality 
are smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen.[68] 
Stopping smoking decreases the risk of death by 18%.[3] 
Other recommendations include influenza vaccination 
once a year, pneumococcal vaccination once every 5 
years, and reduction in exposure to environmental air 
pollution.[3] In those with advanced disease, palliative 
care may reduce symptoms, with morphine improving 
the feelings of shortness of breath.[69] Noninvasive 
ventilation may be used to support breathing.[69] 
6.1 Exercise 
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program of exercise, 
disease management and counseling, coordinated to 
benefit the individual.[70] In those who have had a recent 
exacerbation, pulmonary rehabilitation appears to 
improve the overall quality of life and the ability to 
exercise, and reduce mortality.[71] It has also been shown 
to improve the sense of control a person has over their 
disease, as well as their emotions.[72] Breathing exercises 
in and of themselves appear to have a limited role.[16] 
Pursed lip breathing exercises may be useful.[73][16] 
Being either underweight or overweight can affect the 
symptoms, degree of disability and prognosis of COPD. 
People with COPD who are underweight can improve 
their breathing muscle strength by increasing their 
calorie intake.[4] When combined with regular exercise 
or a pulmonary rehabilitation program, this can lead to 
improvements in COPD symptoms. Supplemental 
nutrition may be useful in those who are malnourished.[74] 
6.2 Bronchodilators 
Inhaled bronchodilators are the primary medications 
used[3] and result in a small overall benefit.[75] There are 
two major types, β2 agonists and anticholinergics; both 
exist in long-acting and short-acting forms. They reduce 
6 MANAGEMENT 
shortness of breath, wheeze and exercise limitation, 
resulting in an improved quality of life.[76] It is unclear if 
they change the progression of the underlying disease.[3] 
In those with mild disease, short-acting agents are 
recommended on an as needed basis.[3] In those with 
more severe disease, long-acting agents are 
recommended.[3] If long-acting bronchodilators are 
insufficient, then inhaled corticosteroids are typically 
added.[3] With respect to long-acting agents, it is unclear 
if tiotropium (a long-acting anticholinergic) or long-
acting beta agonists (LABAs) are better, and it may be 
worth trying each and continuing the one that worked 
best.[77] Both types of agent appear to reduce the risk of 
acute exacerbations by 15–25%.[3] While both may be 
used at the same time, 
any benefit is of questionable significance.[78] 
There are several short-acting β2 agonists available 
including salbutamol (Ventolin) and terbutaline.[79] They 
provide some relief of symptoms for four to six hours.[79] 
7 
 
Long-acting β2 agonists such as salmeterol and 
formoterol are often used as maintenance therapy. Some 
feel the evidence of benefits is limited[80] while others 
view the evidence of benefit as established.[81][82] 
Longterm use appears safe in COPD[83] with adverse 
effects include shakiness and heart palpitations.[3] When 
used with inhaled steroids they increase the risk of 
pneumonia.[3] While steroids and LABAs may work 
better together,[80] it is unclear if this slight benefit 
outweighs the increased risks.[84] 
There are two main anticholinergics used in COPD, 
ipratropium and tiotropium. Ipratropium is a short-acting 
agent while tiotropium is long-acting. Tiotropium is 
associated with a decrease in exacerbations and 
improved quality of life,[78] and tiotropium provides 
those benefits better than ipratropium.[85] It does not 
appear to affect mortality or the overall hospitalization 
rate.[86] Anticholinergics can cause dry mouth and 
urinary tract symptoms.[3] They are also associated with 
increased risk of heart disease and stroke.[87][88] 
Aclidinium, another long acting agent which came to 
market in 2012, has been used as an alternative to 
tiotropium.[89][90] 
6.3 Corticosteroids 
Corticosteroids are usually used in inhaled form but may 
also be used as tablets to treat and prevent acute 
exacerbations. While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have 
not shown benefit for people with mild COPD, they 
decrease acute exacerbations in those with either 
moderate or severe disease.[91] When used in 
combination with a LABA they decrease mortality more 
than either ICS or LABA alone.[92] By themselves they 
have no effect on overall one-year mortality and are 
associated with increased rates of pneumonia.[68] It is 
unclear if they affect the progression of the disease.[3] 
Long-term treatment with steroid tablets is associated 
with significant side effects.[79] 
6.4 Other medication 
Long-term antibiotics, specifically those from the 
macrolide class such as erythromycin, reduce the 
frequency of exacerbations in those who have two or 
more a year.[93][94] This practice may be cost effective in 
some areas of the world.[95] Concerns include that of 
antibiotic resistance and hearing problems with 
azithromycin.[94] Methylxanthines such as theophylline 
generally cause more harm than benefit and thus are 
usually not recommended,[96] but may be used as a 
secondline agent in those not controlled by other 
measures.[4] Mucolytics may be useful in some people 
who have very thick mucus but are generally not 
needed.[55] Cough medicines are not recommended.[79] 
6.5 Oxygen 
Supplemental oxygen is recommended in those with low 
oxygen levels at rest (a partial pressure of oxygen of less 
than 50–55 mmHg or oxygen saturations of less than 
88%).[79][97] In this group of people it decreases the risk 
of heart failure and death if used 15 hours per day[79][97] 
and may improve people’s ability to exercise.[98] In those 
with normal or mildly low oxygen levels, oxygen 
supplementation may improve shortness of breath.[99] 
There is a risk of fires and little benefit when those on 
oxygen continue to smoke.[100] In this situation some 
recommend against its use.[101] During acute 
exacerbations, many require oxygen therapy; the use of 
high concentrations of oxygen without taking into 
account a person’s oxygen saturations may lead to 
increased levels of carbon dioxide and worsened 
outcomes.[102][103] In those at high risk of high carbon 
dioxide levels, oxygen saturations of 88–92% are 
recommended, while for those without this risk 
recommended levels are 94–98%.[103] 
6.6 Surgery 
For those with very severe disease, surgery is sometimes 
helpful and may include lung transplantation or lung 
volume reduction surgery.[3] Lung volume reduction 
surgery involves removing the parts of the lung most 
damaged by emphysema allowing the remaining, 
relatively good lung to expand and work better.[79] Lung 
transplantation is sometimes performed for very severe 
COPD, particularly in younger individuals.[79] 
6.7 Exacerbations 
Acute exacerbations are typically treated by increasing 
the usage of short-acting bronchodilators.[3] This 
commonly includes a combination of a short-acting 
inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergic.[38] These 
medications can be given either via a metered-dose 
inhaler with a spacer or via a nebulizer with both 
appearing to be equally effective.[38] Nebulization may 
be easier for those who are more unwell.[38] 
Oral corticosteroids improve the chance of recovery and 
decrease the overall duration of symptoms.[3][38] They 
work equally well as intravenous steroids but appear to 
have fewer side effects.[104] Five days of steroids work as 
well as ten or fourteen.[105] In those with a severe 
exacerbation, antibiotics improve outcomes.[106] A 
number of different antibiotics may be used including 
amoxicillin, doxycycline and azithromycin; it is unclear 
if one is better than the others.[55] There is no clear 
evidence for those with less severe cases.[106] 
For those with type 2 respiratory failure (acutely raised 
CO2 levels) non-invasive positive pressure ventilation 
decreases the probability of death or the need of 
8 
 
intensive care admission.[3] Additionally, theophylline 
may have a role in those who do not respond to other 
measures.[3] Fewer than 20% of exacerbations require 
hospital admission.[38] In those without acidosis from 
respiratory failure, home care (“hospital at home”) may 
be able to help avoid some admissions.[38][107] 
7 Prognosis 
 
Disability-adjusted life years lost to chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.[108] 
COPD usually gets gradually worse over time and can 
ultimately result in death. It is estimated that 3% of all 
disability is related to COPD.[109] The proportion of 
disability from COPD globally has decreased from 1990 
to 2010 due to improved indoor air quality primarily in 
Asia.[109] The overall number of years lived with 
disability from COPD, however, has increased.[6] 
The rate at which COPD worsens varies with the 
presence of factors that predict a poor outcome, 
including severe airflow obstruction, little ability to 
exercise, shortness of breath, significantly underweight 
or overweight, congestive heart failure, continued 
smoking, and frequent exacerbations.[4] Long-term 
outcomes in COPD can be estimated using the BODE 
index which gives a score of zero to ten depending on 
FEV1, body-mass index, the distance walked in six 
minutes, and the modified MRC dyspnea scale.[110] 
Significant weight loss is a bad sign.[2] Results of 
spirometry are also a good predictor of the future 
progress of the disease but not as good as the BODE 8
 Epidemiology 
Globally, as of 2010, COPD affected approximately 329 
million people (4.8% of the population).[6] The disease 
affects men and women almost equally, as there has been 
increased tobacco use among women in the developed 
world.[111] The increase in the developing world between 
1970 and the 2000s is believed to be related to increasing 
rates of smoking in this region, an increasing population 
and an aging population due to less deaths from other 
causes such as infectious diseases.[3] Some developed 
countries have seen increased rates, some have remained 
stable and some have seen a decrease in COPD 
prevalence.[3] The global numbers are expected to 
continue increasing as risk factors remain common and 
the population continues to get older.[57] 
Between 1990 and 2010 the number of deaths from 
COPD decreased slightly from 3.1 million to 2.9 
million[112] and became the fourth leading cause of 
death.[3] In 2012 it became the third leading cause as the 
number of deaths rose again to 3.1 million.[113] In some 
countries, mortality has decreased in men but increased 
in women.[114] This is most likely due to rates of smoking 
in women and men becoming more similar.[2] COPD is 
more common in older people;[1] it affects 34–200 out of 
1000 people older than 65 years, depending on the pop- 
ulation under review.[1][53] 
In England, an estimated 0.84 million people (of 50 
million) have a diagnosis of COPD; this translates into 
approximately one person in 59 receiving a diagnosis of 
COPD at some point in their lives. In the most 
socioeconomically deprived parts of the country, one in 
32 people were diagnosed with COPD, compared with 
one in 98 in the most affluent areas.[115] In the United 
States approximately 6.3% of the adult population, 
totaling approximately 15 million people, have been 
diagnosed with COPD.[116] 25 million people may have 
COPD if currently undiagnosed cases are included.[117] 
In 2011, there were approximately 730,000 
hospitalizations in the United States for COPD.[118] 
9 History 
The word “emphysema” is derived from the Greek 
ἐμφυσᾶν emphysan meaning "inflate" -itself composed 
of ἐν en, meaning "in", and φυσᾶν physan, meaning 
"breath, blast".[119] The term chronic bronchitis came 
into use in 1808[120] while the term COPD is believed to 
have first been used in 1965.[121] Previously it has been 
known by a number of different names, including 
chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease, chronic 
obstructive respiratory disease, chronic airflow 
obstruction, chronic airflow

Giovanni Battista Morgagni, who made one of the earliest 
recorded descriptions of emphysema in 1769 
limitation, chronic obstructive lung disease, nonspecific 
chronic pulmonary disease, and diffuse obstructive 
pulmonary syndrome. The terms chronic bronchitis and 
emphysema were formally defined in 1959 at the CIBA 
guest symposium and in 1962 at the American Thoracic 
Society Committee meeting on Diagnostic Standards.[121] 
Early descriptions of probable emphysema include: in 
1679 by T. Bonet of a condition of “voluminous lungs” 
and in 1769 by Giovanni Morgagni of lungs which were 
“turgid particularly from air”.[121][122] In 1721 the first 
drawings of emphysema were made by Ruysh.[122] These 
were followed with pictures by Matthew Baillie in 1789 
and descriptions of the destructive nature of the 
condition. In 1814 Charles Badham used “catarrh” to 
describe the cough and excess mucus in chronic 
bronchitis. René Laennec, the physician who invented 
the stethoscope, used the term “emphysema” in his book 
A Treatise on the Diseases of the Chest and of Mediate 
Auscultation (1837) to describe lungs that did not 
collapse when he opened the chest during an autopsy. He 
noted that they did not collapse as usual because they 
were full of air and the airways were filled with mucus. 
In 1842, John Hutchinson invented the spirometer, 
which allowed the measurement of vital capacity of the 
lungs. However, his spirometer could only measure 
volume, not airflow. Tiffeneau and Pinelli in 1947 
described the principles of measuring 
airflow.[121] 
In 1953, Dr. George L. Waldbott, an American allergist, first described a new disease he named “smoker’s 
respiratory syndrome” in the 1953 Journal of the American Medical Association. This was the first association 
between tobacco smoking and chronic respiratory disease.[123] 
Early treatments included garlic, cinnamon and ipecac, among others.[120] Modern treatments were developed 
during the second half of the 20th century. Evidence supporting the use of steroids in COPD were published in 
the late 1950s. Bronchodilators came into use in the 1960s following a promising trial of isoprenaline. Further 
bronchodilators, such as salbutamol, were developed in the 1970s, and the use of LABAs began in the mid- 
1990s.[124] 
10 Society and culture 
See also: COPD Awareness Month 
COPD has been referred to as “smoker’s lung”.[125] Those with emphysema have been known as “pink puffers” 
or “type A” due to their frequent pink complexion, fast respiratory rate and pursed lips,[126][127] and people with 
chronic bronchitis have been referred to as “blue bloaters” or “type B” due to the often bluish color of the skin 
and lips from low oxygen levels and their ankle swelling.[127][128] This terminology is no longer accepted as useful 
as most people with COPD have a combination 
of both.[2][127] 
Many health systems have difficulty ensuring appropriate identification, diagnosis and care of people with COPD; 
Britain’s Department of Health has identified this as a major issue for the National Health Service and has 
introduced a specific strategy to tackle these problems.[129]

10.1 Economics 
Globally, as of 2010, COPD is estimated to result in economic costs of $2.1 trillion, half of which occurring in 
the developing world.[9] Of this total an estimated $1.9 trillion are direct costs such as medical care, while $0.2 
trillion are indirect costs such as missed work.[130] This is expected to more than double by the year 2030.[9] In 
Europe, COPD represents 3% of healthcare spending.[1] In the United States, costs of the disease are estimated 
at $50 billion, most of which is due to exacerbation.[1] COPD was among the most expensive conditions seen in 
U.S. hospitals in 2011, with a total cost of about $5.7 
billion.[118] 
11 Research 
See also: COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
Infliximab, an immune-suppressing antibody, has been tested in COPD but there was no evidence of benefit with 
the possibility of harm.[131] Roflumilast shows promise in decreasing the rate of exacerbations but does not appear 
to change quality of life.[3] A number of new, longacting agents are under development.[3] Treatment with stem 
cells is under study,[132] and while generally safe and with promising animal data there is little human data as of 
2014.[133] 
12 Other animals 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur in a number of other animals and may be caused by exposure 
to tobacco smoke.[134][135] Most cases of the disease, however, are relatively mild.[136] In horses it is also known as 
recurrent airway obstruction and is typically due to an allergic reaction to a fungus contained in straw.[137] COPD 
is also commonly found in old dogs.[138]
