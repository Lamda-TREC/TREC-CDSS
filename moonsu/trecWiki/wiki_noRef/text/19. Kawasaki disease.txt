 Kawasaki 
disease 
Kawasakidisease, also known as Kawasakisyndrome, 
lymph node syndrome, and mucocutaneous lymph 
node syndrome,[1] is an autoimmune disease[2] in which 
the medium-sized blood vessels throughout the body 
become inflamed. It is largely seen in children under five 
years of age. It affects many organ systems, mainly those 
including the blood vessels, skin, mucous membranes, 
and lymph nodes. Its rarest but most serious effect is on 
the heart, where it can cause fatal coronary artery 
aneurysms in untreated children. Without treatment, 
mortality may approach 1%, usually within six weeks of 
onset. With treatment, the mortality rate is 0.17% in the 
U.S.[3] 
Often, a pre-existing viral infection may play a role in its 
pathogenesis.[4] The skin, the conjunctivae of the eyes, 
and the mucous membranes of the mouth become red 
and inflamed. Swelling of the hands and feet is often 
seen and lymph nodes in the neck are often enlarged. A 
recurrent fever, often 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) or higher, is 
characteristic of the acute phase of the disease.[5] In 
untreated children, the fever lasts about 10 days, but may 
range from five to 25 days.[5] The disorder was first 
described in 1967 by Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan.[6] 
1 Classification 
Systemic vasculitis is an inflammatory condition 
affecting arteries and veins throughout the body, and is 
usually caused by a proliferation of cells associated with 
an immune response to a pathogen, or autoimmunity.[7] 
Systemic vasculitides may be classified according to the 
type of cells involved in the proliferation, as well as the 
specific type of tissue damage occurring within the vein 
or arterial walls.[7] Under this classification scheme for 
systemic vasculitis, Kawasaki disease is considered to be 
a necrotizing vasculitis (also called necrotizing 
angeititis), which may be identified histologically by the 
occurrence of necrosis (tissue death), fibrosis, and 
proliferation of cells associated with inflammation in the 
inner layer of the vascular wall.[7][8] (Other diseases 
featuring necrotizing vasculitis include polyarteritis 
nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch-
Schönlein purpura, and ChurgStrauss syndrome.[7]) 
Kawasaki disease may be further classified as a 
mediumsized-vessel vasculitis, affecting medium- and 
smallsized blood vessels,[9][10][11] such as the smaller 
cutaneous vasculature (veins and arteries in the skin) that 
range from 50 to 100 µm in diameter.[12][13] Kawasaki 
disease is also considered to be a primary childhood 
vasculitis, a disorder associated with vasculitis that 
mainly affects children under the age of 18.[14][15] A 
recent, consensus-based evaluation of vasculitides 
occurring primarily in children resulted in a 
classification scheme for these disorders, to distinguish 
them and suggest a more concrete set of diagnostic 
criteria for each.[15] Within this classification of 
childhood vasculitides, Kawasaki disease is, again, a 
predominantly medium-sized vessel vasculitis.[15] 
It is also an autoimmune form of vasculitis,[5] and is not 
associated with ANCA antibodies, unlike other 
vasculitic disorders associated with them (such as 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic 
polyangiitis, and ChurgStrauss syndrome).[7][16] This 
categorization is considered essential for appropriate 
treatment.[17] 
2 Signs and symptoms 
Kawasaki disease often begins with a high and 
persistent fever that is not very responsive to normal 
treatment with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or 
ibuprofen.[18][19] It is the most prominent symptom in 
Kawasaki disease, is a characteristic sign of the acute 
phase of the disease, is normally high (above 39-
40 °C), remittent, and is followed by extreme 
irritability.[19][20] Recently, it is reported to be present 
in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki 
disease;[21][22] nevertheless, it is not present in 100% of 
cases.[23] The first day of fever is considered the first 
day of illness,[18] and the duration of fever is on average 
one to two weeks; in the absence of treatment, it may 
extend for three to four weeks.[5] Prolonged fever is 
associated with higher incidence of cardiac 
involvement.[24] It responds partially to antipyretic 
drugs and does not cease with the introduction of 
antibiotics.[5] However, when appropriate therapy is 
started – intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin – 
the fever is gone after two days.[25] 
Bilateral conjunctival inflammation was reported to be 
the most common symptom after fever.[26][27] It 
typically involves the bulbar conjunctivae, is not 
accompanied by suppuration, and is not painful.[28] It 
usually begins shortly after the onset of fever during 
the acute stage of the disease.[18] Anterior uveitis may 
be present on slitlamp examination.[29][30] Iritis can 
occur, too.[31] Keratic precipitates are another eye 
2 
manifestation (detectable by a slit lamp but are usually 
too small to be seen by the unaided eye).[18][32] 
1 
Kawasaki disease presents with set of oral 
manifestations, the most characteristic changes are the 
bright red (erythema), swollen lips (edema) with vertical 
cracking (fissures) and bleeding.[33] The mucosa of the 
oropharynx may be bright red, and the tongue may have 
a typical "strawberry tongue" appearance (marked 
erythema with prominent gustative papillae).[5][13] These 
oral manifestations are caused by the typical necrotizing 
microvasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.[33] 
Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in 50% to 75% of 
patients, whereas the other features are estimated to 
occur in 90% of patients,[18][26] but sometimes it can be 
the dominant presenting symptom.[32][34] According to 
the definition of the diagnostic criteria, at least one 
impaired lymph node ≥ 1.5 cm in diameter should be 
involved.[13] Affected lymph nodes are painless or 
minimally painful, nonfluctuant, and nonsuppurative; 
erythema of the neighboring skin may occur.[18] Children 
with fever and neck adenitis who do not respond to 
antibiotics should have Kawasaki disease considered as 
part of the differential diagnoses.[18] 
In the acute phase of the disease, changes in the 
peripheral extremities can include erythema of the palms 
and soles, which is often striking with sharp 
demarcation[18] and often accompanied by painful, 
brawny edema of the dorsa of the hands or feet. This is 
why affected children frequently refuse to hold objects 
in their hands or to bear weight on their feet.[5][18] Later, 
during the convalescent or the subacute phase, 
desquamation of the fingers and toes usually begins in 
the periungual region within two to three weeks after the 
onset of fever and may extend to include the palms and 
soles.[38] Around 11% of children affected by the disease 
may continue skin-peeling for many years.[39] One to two 
months after the onset of fever, deep transverse grooves 
across the nails may develop (Beau’s lines),[40] and 
occasionally nails are shed.[40] 
The most common cutaneous manifestation is a diffuse 
macular-papular erythematous rash, which is quite 
nonspecific.[41] The rash varies over time and is 
characteristically located on the trunk; it may further 
spread to involve the face, extremities, and perineum.[5] 
Many other forms of cutaneous lesions have been 
reported; they may include scarlatiniform, papular, 
urticariform, multiformlike erythema, and purpuric 
lesions; even micropustules were reported.[42][43] It can be 
polymorphic, not itchy, and normally observed up to the 
fifth day of fever.[44] However, it is never bullous or 
vesicular.[5] 
In the acute stage of Kawasaki disease, systemic 
inflammatory changes are evident in many organs.[10] 
Joint pain (arthralgia) and swelling, frequently 
symmetrical, and arthritis can also occur.[26] 
Myocarditis,[45] diarrhea,[13] pericarditis, valvulitis, 
aseptic meningitis, pneumonitis, lymphadenitis, and 
hepatitis may be present and are manifested by the 
presence of inflammatory cells in the affected tissues.[10] 
If left untreated, some symptoms will 2 SIGNS AND 
SYMPTOMS 
eventually relent, but coronary artery aneurysms will not 
improve, resulting in a significant risk of death or 
disability due to myocardial infarction.[13] If treated 
quickly, this risk can be mostly avoided and the course 
of illness cut 
short.[46] 
 
Clinical manifestations and time course of Kawasaki 
disease[18][47] 
Other reported nonspecific symptoms include cough, 
rhinorrhea, sputum, vomiting, headache, and seizure.[26] 
The course of the disease can be divided into three 
clinical phases.[13] 
• The acute febrile phase, which usually lasts for one 
to two weeks, is characterized by fever, 
conjunctival injection, erythema of the oral mucosa, 
erythema and swelling of the hands and feet, rash, 
cervical adenopathy, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, 
and hepatic dysfunction.[13] Myocarditis is common 
during this time, and a pericardial effusion may be 
present.[18] Coronary arteritis may be present, but 
aneurysms are generally not yet visible by 
echocardiography. 
• The subacute phase begins when fever, rash, and 
lymphadenopathy resolve at about one to two 
weeks after the onset of fever, but irritability, 
anorexia, and conjunctival injection persist. 
Desquamation of the fingers and toes and 
thrombocytosis are seen during this stage, which 
generally lasts until about four weeks after the onset 
of fever. Coronary artery aneurysms usually 
develop during this time, and the risk for sudden 
death is highest.[18][48] 
3 
• The convalescent stage begins when all clinical 
signs of illness have disappeared, and continues 
until the sedimentation rate returns to normal, 
usually at six to eight weeks after the onset of 
illness.[13] 
The clinical presentation between adults and children 
differs, as adults’ neck lymph nodes are more affected 
(93% of adults versus 15% of children), hepatitis (65% 
versus 
2.2 Other 
10%), and arthralgia (61% versus 24-38%).[13][49] Some 
patients have atypical presentations and may not have 
the classical symptoms. This occurs in particular in 
young infants;[50] those patients are especially at higher 
risk for cardiac artery aneurysms.[18][51]

arteries, which is a complication in a Kawasaki syndrome 
2.1 Cardiac 
The cardiac complications are the most important aspect 
of Kawasaki disease. It is the main cause of heart disease 
acquired in childhood in the United States and Japan.[13] 
In developed nations, it appears to have replaced acute 
rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired 
heart disease in children.[18] Coronary artery aneurysms 
occur as a sequela of the vasculitis in 20-25% of 
untreated children.[52] It is first detected at a mean of 10 
days of illness and the peak frequency of coronary artery 
dilation or aneurysms occurs within four weeks of 
onset.[48] Aneurysms are classified into small (internal 
diameter of vessel wall <5 mm), medium (diameter 
ranging from 5– 8 mm), and giant (diameter > 8 mm).[13] 
Saccular and fusiform aneurysms usually develop 
between 18 and 25 days after the onset of illness.[18] Even 
when treated with high-dose IVIG regimens within the 
first 10 days of illness, 5% of children with Kawasaki 
disease develop at the least transient coronary artery 
dilation and 1% develop giant aneurysms.[53][54][55] Death 
can occur due either to myocardial infarction secondary 
to blood clot formation in a coronary artery aneurysm or 
to rupture of a large coronary artery aneurysm. Death is 
most common two to 12 weeks after the onset of 
illness.[18] 
Many risk factors predicting coronary artery aneurysms 
have been identified,[24] including persistent fever after 
IVIG therapy,[56][57] low hemoglobin concentrations, low 
albumin concentrations, high white-blood-cell count, 
high band count, high CRP concentrations, male sex, and 
age less than one year.[58] Coronary artery lesions 
resulting from Kawasaki disease change dynamically 
with time.[5] Resolution one to two years after the onset 
of the disease has been observed in half of vessels with 
coronary aneurysms.[59][60] Narrowing of the coronary 
artery, which occurs as a result of the healing process of 
the vessel wall, often leads to significant obstruction of 
the blood vessel and lead to the heart not receiving 
enough blood and oxygen.[59] This can eventually lead to 
heart muscle tissue death (myocardial infarction).[59] 
MI caused by thrombotic occlusion in an aneurysmal, 
stenotic, or both aneurysmal and stenotic coronary artery 
is the main cause of death from Kawasaki disease.[61] The 
highest risk of MI occurs in the first year after the onset 
of the disease.[61] MI in children presents with different 
symptoms from those in adults. The main symptoms 
were shock, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain; chest 
pain was most common in older children.[61] Most of 
these children had the attack occurring during sleep or at 
rest, and around one-third of attacks were 
asymptomatic.[18] 
Valvular insufficiencies, particularly of mitral or 
tricuspid valves, are often observed in the acute phase of 
Kawasaki disease due to inflammation of the heart valve 
or inflammation of the heart muscle-induced myocardial 
dysfunction, regardless of coronary involvement.[59] 
These lesions mostly disappear with the resolution of 
acute illness,[62] but a very small group of the lesions 
persist and progress.[63] There is also late-onset aortic or 
mitral insufficiency caused by thickening or deformation 
of fibrosed valves, with the timing ranging from several 
months to years after the onset of Kawasaki disease.[64] 
Some of these lesions require valve replacement.[65] 
2.2 Other 
Other Kawasaki disease complications have been 
described, such as aneurysm of other arteries: aortic 
aneurysm,[66] with a higher number of reported cases 
involving the abdominal aorta,[67][68] axillary artery 
aneurysm,[69] brachiocephalic artery aneurysm,[70] 
aneurysm of iliac and femoral arteries, and renal artery 
aneurysm.[5][71] Other vascular complications can occur 
such as increased wall thickness and decreased 
distensibility of carotid arteries,[72] aorta,[73] and 
brachioradial artery.[74] This change in the vascular tone 
secondary to endothelial dysfunction.[71] In addition, 
children with Kawasaki disease, with or without 
coronary artery complications, may have a more adverse 
4 
cardiovascular risk profile,[74] such as high blood 
pressure, obesity, and abnormal serum lipid profile.[75] 
Gastrointestinal complications in Kawasaki disease are 
similar to those observed in Henoch-Schönlein 
purpura,[69] such as: intestinal obstruction,[76] colon 
swelling,[77] intestinal ischemia,[78] intestinal 
pseudoobstruction,[79] and acute abdomen.[80] 
Eye changes associated with the disease have been 
described since the 1980s, being found as uveitis, 
iridocyclitis, conjunctival hemorrhage,[81][82][83] optic 
neuritis,[69] amaurosis, and ocular artery obstruction.[84] It 
can also be found as necrotizing vasculitis, progressing 
into peripheral gangrene.[85] 
The neurological complications per central nervous 
system lesions are increasingly reported.[86] The 
neurological complications found are 
meningoencephalitis,[87] subdural effusion,[88][89] cerebral 
hypoperfusion,[90] cerebral ischemia and infarct,[91] 
cerebellar infarction,[92] manifesting with seizures, 
chorea, hemiplegia, mental confusion, lethargy and 
coma,[69] or even a cerebral infarction with no 
neurological manifestations.[91] Other neurological 
complications from cranial nerve involvement are 
reported as ataxia,[69] facial palsy,[93] and sensorineural 
hearing loss.[94][95] Behavioral changes are thought to be 
caused by localised cerebral hypoperfusion,[90] can 
include attention deficits, learning deficits, emotional 
disorders (emotional lability, fear of night, and night 
terrors), and internalization problems 
(anxious, depressive or aggressive behavior).[96][97] 
3 Causes 
As the cause(s) of Kawasaki disease remain unknown, 
the illness is more accurately referred to as Kawasaki 
syndrome. Like all autoimmune diseases, its cause is 
presumably the interaction of genetic and environmental 
factors, possibly including an infection. The specific 
cause is unknown,[98][99][100] but current theories center 
primarily on immunological causes. Evidence 
increasingly points to an infectious etiology,[101] but 
debate continues on whether the cause is a conventional 
antigenic substance or a superantigen.[102] Researchers at 
Boston Children’s Hospital reported, “some studies have 
found associations between the occurrence of Kawasaki 
disease and recent exposure to carpet cleaning or 
residence near a body of stagnant water; however, cause 
and effect have not been established.”[103] 
Other data show a clear correlation between Kawasaki 
disease and tropospheric wind patterns; winds blowing 
from central Asia correlate with Kawasaki disease cases 
in Japan, Hawaii, and San Diego.[104] This association 
with tropospheric winds has been shown to be modulated 
at seasonal and interannual timescales by the El Niño– 
Southern Oscillation phenomenon,[105] further indicating 
the agent responsible for the disease is a wind-borne 
pathogen. Efforts are underway to identify the suspected 
pathogen in air-filters flown at altitude above Japan.[106] 
An association has been identified with an SNP in the 
ITPKC gene, which codes an enzyme that negatively 
regulates T-cell activation.[107] Regardless of where they 
are living, Japanese children are more likely than other 
children to manifest the disease, which suggests genetic 
susceptibility.[103] The HLA-B51 serotype has been 
found to be associated with endemic instances of the 
disease.[108] 
 4 DIAGNOSIS 
4 Diagnosis 
 
Angiography showing ectatic LAD, with largest aneurysm = 
6.5 mm in diameter 
Kawasaki disease can only be diagnosed clinically (i.e., 
by medical signs and symptoms). No specific laboratory 
test exists for this condition. It is difficult to establish the 
diagnosis, especially early in the course of the illness, 
and frequently children are not diagnosed until they have 
seen several health-care providers. Many other serious 
illnesses can cause similar symptoms, and must be 
considered in the differential diagnosis, including scarlet 
fever, toxic shock syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
and childhood mercury poisoning (infantile acrodynia). 
Classically, five days of fever[110] plus four of five 
diagnostic criteria must be met to establish the diagnosis. 
The criteria are: 
1. erythema of the lips or oral cavity or cracking of the 
lips 
2. rash on the trunk 
3. swelling or erythema of the hands or feet 
4. red eyes (conjunctival injection) 
5 
5. swollen lymph node in the neck of at least 15 mm 
Many children, especially infants, eventually diagnosed 
with Kawasaki disease, do not exhibit all of the above 
criteria. In fact, many experts now recommend treating 
for Kawasaki disease even if only three days of fever 
have passed and at least three diagnostic criteria are 
present, especially if other tests reveal abnormalities 
consistent with Kawasaki disease. In addition, the 
diagnosis can be made purely by the detection of 
coronary artery aneurysms in the proper clinical setting. 
4.1 Investigations 
A physical examination will demonstrate many of the 
features listed above. Blood tests 
• Complete blood count may reveal normocytic 
anemia and eventually thrombocytosis. 
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be elevated. 
• C-reactive protein will be elevated. 
• Liver function tests may show evidence of hepatic 
inflammation and low serum albumin. 
Other optional tests include: 
• Electrocardiogram may show evidence of 
ventricular dysfunction or, occasionally, arrhythmia 
due to myocarditis. 
• Echocardiogram may show subtle coronary artery 
changes or, later, true aneurysms. 
• Ultrasound or computerized tomography may show 
hydrops (enlargement) of the gallbladder. 
• Urinalysis may show white blood cells and protein 
in the urine (pyuria and proteinuria) without 
evidence of bacterial growth. 
• Lumbar puncture may show evidence of aseptic 
meningitis. 
• Angiography was historically used to detect 
coronary artery aneurysms, and remains the gold 
standard for their detection, but is rarely used today 
unless coronary artery aneurysms have already been 
detected by echocardiography. 
• Temporal artery biopsy 
5 Treatment 
Children with Kawasaki disease should be hospitalized 
and cared for by a physician who has experience with 
this disease. When in an academic medical center, care 
is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric 
rheumatology, and pediatric infectious disease 
specialists (although no specific infectious agent has 
been identified as yet).[103] Treatment should be started 
as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent damage to 
the coronary arteries. 
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the standard 
treatment for Kawasaki disease[111] and is administered 
in high doses with marked improvement usually noted 
within 24 hours. If the fever does not respond, an 
additional dose may have to be considered. In rare cases, 
a third dose may be given to the child. IVIG by itself is 
most useful within the first seven days of onset of fever, 
in terms of preventing coronary artery aneurysm. 
Salicylate therapy, particularly aspirin, remains an 
important part of the treatment (though questioned by 
some)[112] but salicylates alone are not as effective as 
IVIG. Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the 
fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when 
the patient returns home, usually for two months to 
prevent blood clots from forming. Except for Kawasaki 
disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise 
normally not recommended for children due to its 
association with Reye’s syndrome. Because children 
with Kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to 
several months, vaccination against varicella and 
influenza is required, as these infections are most likely 
to cause Reye’s syndrome.[113] 
Corticosteroids have also been used,[114] especially when 
other treatments fail or symptoms recur, but in a 
randomized controlled trial, the addition of 
corticosteroid to immune globulin and aspirin did not 
improve outcome.[115] Additionally, corticosteroid use in 
the setting of Kawasaki disease is associated with 
increased risk of coronary artery aneurysm, so its use is 
generally contraindicated in this setting. In cases of 
Kawasaki disease refractory to IVIG, cyclophosphamide 
and plasma exchange have been investigated as possible 
treatments, with variable outcomes. 
IL-1 Receptor antagonist (anakinra) can prevent 
coronary lesion in the mouse KD model. This prevention 
shows even with three-days-delay in treatment in 
mice.[116] 
Treatments exist for iritis and other eye symptoms. 
Another treatment may include the use of infliximab. 
Infliximab works by binding tumour necrosis factor 
alpha.[117]

6 Prognosis 
With early treatment, rapid recovery from the acute 
symptoms can be expected, and the risk of coronary 
artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute 
symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (i.e. the 
patient will recover eventually), but the risk of coronary 
artery involvement is much greater. Overall, about 2% of 
patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis. 
Patients who have had Kawasaki disease should have an 
echocardiogram initially every few weeks, and then 
every one or two years to screen for progression of 
cardiac involvement. 
Laboratory evidence of increased inflammation 
combined with demographic features (male sex, age less 
than six months or greater than eight years) and 
incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of 
a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease.[58][118] The 
likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be 
determined in large measure by its initial size, in 
7 
which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood of regression.[119][120] Other factors are positively associated 
with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, 
fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment. [60] 
The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms.[5] The worst 
prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms.[121] This severe outcome may require further treatment such as 
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty,[122] coronary artery stenting,[123] bypass grafting,[124] and even cardiac 
transplantation.[125] 
A relapse of symptoms may occur soon after initial treatment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization 
and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic and nonallergic acute reactions, aseptic meningitis, fluid 
overload and, rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for 
Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially compared with the risk of nontreatment. Also, evidence 
indicates Kawasaki disease produces altered lipid metabolism that persists beyond clinical resolution of the 
disease. 
7 Epidemiology 
Kawasaki disease affects boys more than girls, with people of Asian ethnicity, particularly Japanese and Korean 
people, most susceptible, as well as people of AfroCaribbean ethnicity. The disease was rare in Caucasians until 
the last few decades, and incidence rate fluctuates from country to country. 
Currently, Kawasaki disease is the most commonly diagnosed pediatric vasculitis in the world. By far, the highest 
incidence of Kawasaki disease occurs in Japan, with the most recent study placing the attack rate at 218.6 per 
100,000 children <5 years of age (about one in 450 children). At this present attack rate, more than one in 150 
children in Japan will develop Kawasaki disease during their lifetimes. 
However, its incidence in the United States is increasing. Kawasaki disease is predominantly a disease of young 
children, with 80% of patients younger than five years of age. About 2,000-4,000 cases are identified in the U.S. 
each year (9 to 19 per 100,000 children younger than 5 years of age).[103][126][127] 
In the United Kingdom, estimates of incidence rate vary because of the rarity of Kawasaki disease. However, it is 
believed to affect fewer than one in every 25,000 people.[128] Incidence of the disease doubled from 1991 to 2000, 
however, with four cases per 100,000 children in 1991 compared with a rise of eight cases per 100,000 in 2000.[129] 
8 History 
The disease was first reported by Tomisaku Kawasaki in a four-year-old child with a rash and fever at the Red Cross 
Hospital in Tokyo in January 1961, and he later published a report on 50 similar cases.[130] Later, Kawasaki and 
colleagues were persuaded of definite cardiac involvement when they studied and reported 23 cases, of which 11 
(48%) patients had abnormalities detected by an electrocardiogram.[131] In 1974, the first description of this disorder 
8 
was published in the English-language literature.[132] In 1976, Melish et al. described the same illness in 16 children 
in Hawaii.[133] Melish and Kawasaki had independently developed the same diagnostic criteria for the disorder, 
which are still used today to make the diagnosis of classic Kawasaki disease. 
A question was raised whether the disease only started during the period between 1960 and 1970, but later a 
preserved heart of a seven-year-old boy who died in 1870 was examined and showed three aneurysms of the 
coronary arteries with clots, as well as pathologic changes consistent with Kawasaki disease.[134] Kawasaki disease 
is now recognized worldwide. In the United States and other developed nations, it appears to have replaced acute 
rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.[135]
